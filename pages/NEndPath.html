      <p>
        You head down the path and hear a branch break behind you, afraid of
        what it could be you begin to run, but as you do you trip on the root of
        a tree and fall hittng your head, the next time you open your eyes you
        find yourself laying in bed at your home, thinking about the strange
        dream you had, you feel a slight sting on your arm and look down to
        discover a scratch.
