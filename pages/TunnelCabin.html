    <h1>The Tunnel Under</h1>
    <p>
      You open the trap door and head down the ladder. You walk down a tunnel lined with torches. At the end of the tunnel you find two paths. One is covered in complete darkness. The other looks like there is some kind of light at the end of it. You feel your only options are to
      <span class="highlight">Follow the Light</span> or 
      <span class="highlight">Go into the Darkness</span>. 
    </p>
